# Programming Assignments - Week 01

## Initialization

Welcome to the first assignment of the hyper parameters
tuning specialization. It is very important that you
regularize your model properly because it could dramatically
improve your results.

By completing this assignment you will:

\- Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.

\- Implement dropout and see it work on data.

\- Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

\- Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.

This assignment prepares you well for the upcoming assignment. Take your time to complete it and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises. In some code blocks, you will find a "#GRADED FUNCTION: functionName" comment. Please do not modify it. After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 80% to pass. Good luck :) !

## Gradient Checking
Welcome to this week's third programming assignment! You will be implementing gradient checking to make sure that your backpropagation implementation is correct. By completing this assignment you will:

\- Implement gradient checking from scratch.

\- Understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation.

\- Recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula.

\- Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
